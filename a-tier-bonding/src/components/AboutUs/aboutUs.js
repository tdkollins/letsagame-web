          My, it seems as though you have stumbled upon our humble website! 
          We would like to welcome you to Let’s-a-Game, a biannual, (mostly) 
          Nintendo charity marathon where a group of friends play games for 
          the power of good. Each event, 120 hours of games, singing, dancing, 
          and silliness is held in an effort to raise as much money as possible 
          for a good cause. Viewers participate directly, talking via live chat, 
          donating towards fun incentives, hanging out and having a good time. 
          Come join us for our 10th event, Let's-A-Game Legacy, in support of Help Hope Live,
           beginning on January 1st 8am EST!
